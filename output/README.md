# Output Folder: Contact Sheets and Logs

This folder contains the results generated by the EEG Source Reconstruction Pipeline.

## What You See

- **Source Space Contact Sheets**  
  3D visualizations of source activations for each subject and experimental night.  
  - Averaged maps show absolute source activity.  
  - Comparison maps (e.g., Stim vs. Pre, Post vs. Stim, Post vs. Pre) are scaled to a fixed range of ±300%.

- **Sensor Space Contact Sheets**  
  2D topographical maps displaying sensor-level activity for each subject and experimental night.  
  - Averaged maps show intact sensor data.  
  - Comparison maps are displayed with a fixed range of ±300%.

- **Log File**  
  A detailed log (`comparison_run.log`) records the processing steps, warnings, and any errors encountered during the pipeline run.
